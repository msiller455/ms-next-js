# Next.js


## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a web application framework built with the React library. It's used to create front end UI's, and its approach is designed to enhance the developer and end user experience. To break it down a bit further...

### *What is a framework?*

A framework is a pre-built set of tools and functions used to build or achieve something specific. Be it a client-facing website, a fullstack web application etc. Frameworks generally have a specific architecture or set of rules you need to implement and follow in order to build the intended product. Frameworks that have more rules that need to be strictly followed or a more rigidly defined architecture are known as *opinionated frameworks* whereas frameworks that allow a little more flexibility in their structure and implementation are known as *unopinionated frameworks*.

### *What is a library?*

A library is a bundle of helpful tools and functions available for developers to use. Unlike frameworks, there are no overlying rules and architectures to follow in order to use the tools and functions provided by a library. Developers are free to pick and choose what they would like to use from a library in order to implement whatever functionality is needed.
